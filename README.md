# Biosonar Responsivity - Framework with Simulated Bat *Vespertillio numeralis*

This repository contains the MATLAB code and data used in the analyses and simulations for the paper:

**[Biosonar Responsivity Sets the Stage for the Terminal Buzz](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.16.659925v1)**  

The codebase implements the framework for computing *responsivity*, a new metric that captures the fine-grained temporal precision in echolocation behaviour, and validates it against both simulated and high-resolution field datasets. This toolkit provides scripts to simulate target pursuit sequences, extract call dynamics from real bat recordings, and compute critical behavioural transitions such as the **buzz readiness point** and **reaction time limit** ($$T_{b^*}$$).

##  Field Data Analysis Kit `/mat`

### `arrayDataAnalyzer.m`  
Core class for parsing multi-channel audio files from the field array recordings. Includes methods for extracting call timing, durations, computing call rate, estimating velocity, and segmenting for responsivity analyses.

### `arrayDataAnalyzerwithBuzz.m`  
An extended version of `arrayDataAnalyzer` that includes semi-automated buzz detection and validation routines for aligning and extracting detected calls.

### `AudioFileIterator.m`

Utility class that iterates through a set of multi-channel .wav files and applies batch analysis. Used during automated dataset construction.

### `analyzer_files.m`  
Helper script that loads field datasets, applies relevant functions in `arrayDataAnalyzer`, and saves the intermediate output to `.mat` files for further analysis. Run through files while processing data. 

## Data

The outputs of the field data processing are stored in `results` and the processed data are stored in `data`.

## Simulation Scripts `/mat`

### `simulating_sequences.m`

Script to generate synthetic foraging trajectories with randomised prey motion. The resulting call sequences model the batâ€™s response to variable relative velocity, allowing comparison with field data. Here, used to generate plots. Adopt as fits.

### `foraging_sequence.m`  
Function used within the simulation pipeline to generate an individual preyâ€“bat trajectory, compute call emission timing, and apply the responsivity framework.

## Responsivity and Modelling

### `responsivity_curves.m`  
Extracts and plots responsivity metrics across both real and simulated datasets. Outputs aligned timelines with `Tb*`, `Rmax`, and buzz onset.

### `call_duration_model.m`  
Calculates and plots the onset of call duration contraction across sequences. Used to validate that shortening occurs in accordance with decreasing echo delay and increasing call rate.

### `reaction_times.m`

Spatiotemporal parameter plots.

### `delta_plots.m`

Models and call rate against $$k_r$$ and velocity.

### `time_to_intercept.m`

Models the time to intercept based on the relative velocity between the chaser and the target.
